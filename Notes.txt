 Thoughts:

    - The prototype is a comparison device. It needs to:
    1 Draw a game instruction - DONE
    2 Wait for user input - DONE
    3 Read and compare user input + give feedback on result - ON IT
        - You need to draw what the player built
    4 Set a timer to 2 seconds
    5 draw new game instruction
    
    Repeat
